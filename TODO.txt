(1)**Having issues with mobile safari/adblock browsers related to attachment-fixed/transform animations.  
- Used media queries to allow transform animations for devices >= 800px.
-- Update --
This issue seems more complicated than I first thought.  The bug persists even without transform animations.  I need to test if it has actually has something to do with transition animations or if it's a bug more closely related to react-router.
-- Update --
I was able to get around the issue by moving the background settings to #root and adding an overflow-y: scroll + -webkit-overflow-scrolling:touch; to the direct child div.  Also, adding to root and the div child a height of 100vh/100% respectively to fix the white background issue in iOS (4).

This fix breaks scrolling through window.scroll and many other javascript options.  The only way I was able to get around it is by using the following:

document.getElementsByClassName("logo-container")[0].scrollIntoView({behavior: "smooth", block: "end", inline: "nearest"});

Since animations are not exactly part of the issue, I was able to remove the transform media queries previously implemented.  



(2)**Back to top btn's icon position changed in mobile for some reason.
- Added margin: 0 auto 5px to img.  Hopefully this will fix the issue?
-- Update --
Didn't work.  I'll probably have to connect an android device to debug things remotely...
- Fixed! Changed img container padding to 0. 


(3)**Had issues with favicons not showing when run by python server.  
- Fixed by moving icons to favicon folder and adding its directory to staticfile_dir.



(4)**Android device has issues with bg height not spanning 100% of viewport.
- Fixed by setting html height to 100vh.
- Funny enough, android devices don't seem to have an issue with transition animations or the 'back to top arrow being offset' issue.
- Look at transform animation issues for more details.
